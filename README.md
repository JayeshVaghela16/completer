What is completer?
=======
completer is a Photoshop Script written in Javascript and intended to simplify the handoff of designer created PSD's to developers. Rather than simply exporting layers or layer comps to PDF, completer will generate versions that overlay font face, color, size and other information that may be useful during development.
